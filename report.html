I had to assume that the articles were already sorted in order of date published, or else the client would have to sort through thousands of articles from their own browser, hence making the website loading time too long.
I had to assume that the homepage's HTML would be updated regularly at the server side with new articles by using a server-side script, so that the website still works without Javascript applied on the client side. However, I kept the metadata of the articles (under handlebars.js) for the search function, which can only be used when JS is enabled.
