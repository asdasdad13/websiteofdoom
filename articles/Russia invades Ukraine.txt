Following the 2014 annexation of Crimea, and ongoing political and military support to Russia-backed occupation forces controlling parts of the eastern Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, the Russian government launched a full military attack across Ukrainian territory in the early hours of February 24, 2022. Military installations, airports, civilian housing, and key infrastructure have been targeted and bombed, including in the capital Kyiv and other major cities such as Kharkiv in the northeast, and Odesa and Kherson in the south. The Ukrainian military has been responding to the attacks, and the government has declared martial law.\nTwo weeks into the war, over 2 million Ukrainians have become refugees in neighboring countries in Central Europe, with a majority fleeing to Moldova, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, and Romania, while many more are internally displaced. The Russian army has continuously bombed civilian infrastructure, including houses, hospitals, and schools, causing the death of at least 1,300 civilians. It has also registered several thousands of military casualties on its side.\nPresident Putin laid out his vision of a Ukraine reintegrated into Russia\’s sphere of influence in a rambling one-hour speech on February 21, and co-opted Belarus into the coordination of Russia\’s military attack on Ukraine. Russia\’s own citizens have been subjected to a totalizing wave of media stories that includes frequent false claims about Ukraine being led by a “Nazi” regime. It is unclear how Russian public opinion will react or evolve to these claims over time, as many Russians have close ties to Ukraine, and know this to be false. There are already signs of unprecedented opposition to Putin’s decision in a country where challenging nationalistic discourse and the status quo carry profound consequences. The economic effects of Russia’s actions, including the halting of the Nord Stream gas pipeline in which Moscow invested billions, and the free fall of the Russian ruble, are other major factors that will influence how Russians assess Putin’s actions.\nInternational players have reacted in various ways: the European Union has declared a ban on air travel and imposed drastic sanctions while absorbing the majority of the refugees. The US and the UK have imposed similar sanctions and NATO has reinforced its military presence while individual NATO members are providing weapons to Ukraine.\nThere has also been an outpouring of support from the private sector as banks, retailers, food and beverage chains, energy companies, tech giants, and more have halted services in Russia or pulled out altogether.\nTurkey, also a NATO member, has been playing a mediator role while shipping drones to Ukraine.\nChina, while recognizing the territorial integrity of Ukraine, supports Russia yet remained silent during the UN vote in early March condemning Russia’s invasion.\nIn former Soviet states, there is a widening gap between official reactions of silence or support for Russia, and public opinion, which, while still divided, includes open support for Ukraine, notably on social media. Meanwhile, Moldova has absorbed over 200,000 Ukrainian refugees, and Georgia, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan are witnessing the first waves of migrants from Russia who leave their country for political reasons or in anticipation of a major economic crisis at home.\nBut perhaps the main challenge for all is verifying information and avoiding disinformation, one of Moscow’s main weapons in this situation.\nInitial reliable sources with frequent updates in English:\nThe Kyiv-based English-language newspaper Kyiv Independent.\nRiga-based independent russophone and anglophone media outlet Meduza.
